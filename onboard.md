# CSE110 Group 7 - RIVER

Welcome to the CSE 110 Group 7 GitHub Repository! Our team is called RIVER, which is an acronym for Reflection, Improvement, Values, Empowerment, Refinement. Throughout spring quarter, we have created a digital Bullet Journal. 

Learn more about each of our members and our goals on the [RIVER Team Page](admin/team.md).

In this folder, you can see the full [writeup](admin/cipipeline/phase1.md), [video](dmin/cipipeline/phase1.mp4), and accompanying flowcharts [here](admin/cipipeline/phase1.png) and [here](admin/cipipeline/phase2.png). 

## Design

We keep all of the design documentation of our RIVER Bullet Journal app inside the **/specs** folder.

- See our 15 **architecture decision records (ADR)**,  [ADRS](https://github.com/cse110-w21-group7/cse110-SP21-group7/tree/main/specs/adr).

- You can find our pitch document at this [link](https://github.com/cse110-w21-group7/cse110-SP21-group7/tree/main/specs/pitch). In this file, we go over our team's Problem Statement, Problem Constraints, proposed design, early iterations of our design, rabbit holes, and No-gos.

- Our team has come up with multiple UI versions of RIVER Bullet Journal together, you can find them [here](https://github.com/cse110-w21-group7/cse110-SP21-group7/tree/main/specs/interface)!

<!-- - First version of design style guide is [here](https://github.com/zvidmarb/cse110-w21-group23/blob/master/specs/style/DesignGuidev1.pdf). -->
<!-- TODO: ask for style guide -->

- To desgin this website, we created 5 [user personas](https://github.com/cse110-w21-group7/cse110-SP21-group7/tree/main/specs/users) for potential users of the RIVER journal.

## Sprints
#### Once we finished our rough design of the website, we moved on to implement our RIVER Bullet Journal. To realize our project, we had 3 sprints following the agile method with a Final Retro session in the end.
