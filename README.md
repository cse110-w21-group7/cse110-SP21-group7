Our team is called RIVER, an acronym for Reflection, Improvement, Values, Empowerment, Refinement. Throughout spring quarter, we will be creating a digital Bullet Journal. In our Bullet Journal, the user will have the ability to enter entries for individual day, view events in a weekly manner, search individual entries, and store media in customized collection.

Learn more about each of our members and our goals on the [RIVER Team Page](admin/team.md).
