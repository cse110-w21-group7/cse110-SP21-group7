### Team 7 R.I.V.E.R.


### How to access the repo: Brett and Ivan


### Agile practice: Yuzi


### CI pipeline pr demo: Noah


### Challenges: William and Alvin
- CI/CD pipeline didn't include testing
- Didn't utilize the user-center design well
- The design artifact wasn't closely related to the actual implementation
- Product quality (QA), we didn't have much tests
- Follow the wireframes instead of the other way around
- We didn't follow the plan very well
- didn't use versioning
- code simplicity, many duplicates
- We did not do story points for issues since we are new to the framework and language, it's difficult to estimate

### Victories: Katherine and Rachel
- Organic Agile, at first more of a formality, then we really start to use it to our advantage
- We became better at communicating on the issues we are working on
- Github workflow, creating issues, making PR, review PR (discussion), Kanban board
- Better team dynamics, communicating where we are at with issues, how much we can contribute

### Possible future features: Thanh
- more QA
- better user interface
- better schema for database
- better practice for db transaction
- ability to access multiple weeks in the weekly log
- User can have the ability to go to one specific day based on the date
- code coverage on the CI pipeline
- auto-migration for tasks
