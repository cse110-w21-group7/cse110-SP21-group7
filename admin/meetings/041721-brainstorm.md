1. Look back at the past week
    - How's everything going? Suggestion for better workflow:
        - Check your slack often and react to other people's messages
        - GitHub branch
            - Create new branch when committing so you don't commit directly to main
        - PR merging (leave for review when not sure)
            - Otherwise if it's a small change you can merge yourself
        - Anything else?
            - Two meetings per week (date and time TBD)
    - TODO list check-off
    - Any roadblocks in the past week
