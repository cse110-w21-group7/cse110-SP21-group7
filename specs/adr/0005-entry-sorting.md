# Sorting Feature

* Status: proposed
* Deciders: entire team
* Date: 2021-05-01

## Context and Problem Statement

Sometimes an entry gets too long and too difficult to read.
How can the bullet journal make entries easier to read?

## Considered Options

* Color-coding (color bullet types)
* Denoting type by icon
* Sorting (sort bullet types into separate sections)

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: both "Denoting type by icon" and "Sorting", because

* Sorting divides content into sections for easier reading
* Using icons associates bullet types with meaningful images
  * Makes reading bullets easier for users

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Color-coding
* Good, because color association is effective
* Good, because adds an attractive design element to the bullet journal
* Bad, because could become chaotic/cluttered
* Bad, user would have to reference a key in order to understand meaning

### Denoting Type by Icon
* Good, because icons have meaning that can be easily inferred
* Good, strongly differentiates different bullets in the daily log list
* Bad, too many different icons can me the page look cluttered

### Sorting
* Good, because user can choose how to display their content (sorting can be toggled)
* Good, because allows for easier reading of content (sorting is an advantage of a digital bullet journal)
* Bad, because the user has to toggle the view of the screen in order to get this view
