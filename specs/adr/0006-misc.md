## Context and Problem Statement
Which browsers are we focused on supporting with our web application?
## Considered Options
* Chromium only
* Native browsers (Safari, Edge, etc.)
* Chromium and Safari
## Sources
* [Chromium is the most common browser](https://gs.statcounter.com/)
## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Chromium only", because most people use Chromium browsers.  
The way we implement most features will likely also naturally be supported on other common browsers (i.e. Safari and Edge). However, we will actively work to ensure that everything we do works on Chrome.
### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->
* Time is not wasted ensuring that all browsers are supported
* Most potential users will already have the browser required, so they will be able to use the app
### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
* There are likely a few potential users that will not have full functionality due to using a different browser
