## Context and Problem Statement
Which browsers are we focused on supporting with our web application?
## Considered Options
* Chromium only
* Native browsers (Safari, Edge, etc.)
* Chromium and Safari
## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Chromium only", because most college students use Chromium browsers and they are our target audience.  
Additionally, the way we implement most features will likely also be supported on other common browsers (i.e. Safari and Edge)
### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->
* Time is not wasted ensuring that all browsers are supported
* Most potential users will already have the browser required, so they will be able to use the app
### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
* There are likely a few potential users that will not have full functionality due to using a different browser
