# Navigation Bar

* Status: proposed
* Deciders: entire team
* Date: 2021-05-01
* Technical Story: TODO

## Context and Problem Statement

An advantage of a digital bullet journal is having the ability to quickly and easily navigate through content. 
How should the user navigate the bullet journal?

## Considered Options

* Navigation Bar
* Index Page

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: both "Navigation Bar" and "Index Page", because 

* Index Page is core component of a bullet journal and must be included
* Navigation Bar provides easiest access to navigational tools beyond Index Page
* Navigation from either is essentially the same
  * Only difference being the Navigation Bar is constantly accessible whereas the Index Page has to be navigated to first

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Navigation Bar
* Good, because always accessible
* Good, because centralizes navigation
* Bad, because creates redundancy in navigation (could also be a good thing)

### Index
* Good, because realizes a core component of the bullet journal
* Good, because familiar to users
* Bad, because users have to navigate to Index Page before navigating elsewhere
