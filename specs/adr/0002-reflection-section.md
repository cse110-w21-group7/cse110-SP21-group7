* Status: proposed
* Deciders: entire team
* Date: 2021-05-01
* Technical Story: TODO

## Context and Problem Statement

One of the main themes of the RIVER bullet journal is reflection.
How should the bullet journal achieve this reflection theme?

## Considered Options

* Mood Tracker
* Reflection Questions

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: both "Mood Tracker" and "Reflection Questions", because

* Both are important in getting the user to reflect on their experiences
* Both can be combined into one "Reflection Section" 
* Mood Tracker can provide visual indication of reflection (color-coding according to mood)
* Reflection Questions can inspire user to record thoughts

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Mood Tracker
* Good, because simple way to reflect
* Good, because effective to get the user thinking introspectively
* Bad, because not detailed enough for more thoughtful reflection

### Reflection Questions
* Good, because can target specific areas to reflect on
* Good, because allows for breadth/depth of reflection
* Bad, because more time-consuming
